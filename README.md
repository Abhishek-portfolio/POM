Page Object Model (POM) Testing with Cucumber and Selenium

This project demonstrates how to implement Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for automated testing with Cucumber and Selenium WebDriver in Java. POM helps in creating a clear structure for your tests by separating the page logic and test scripts, making the code more maintainable and reusable.

Project Overview
Purpose: This project is designed to test the login functionality of a website using Page Object Model (POM) in Java. It leverages Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD) testing and Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.

Page Object Model (POM): POM is a design pattern where each web page is represented as a separate class. This class contains methods for interacting with elements on that page, and this separation helps in reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

Test Scenario: The test scenario involves verifying that a user can log in successfully to the website. It includes navigating to the login page, entering the login credentials, clicking the login button, and verifying the redirection to the homepage.

How the Page Object Model Works
Page Classes: Each page of the application (e.g., LoginPage, HomePage) is represented as a separate class. Each class contains methods to interact with the elements on that page, like entering text in fields, clicking buttons, etc.

Feature Files: The Cucumber feature files are written in Gherkin syntax. They describe the test scenarios in plain English, making them easy to understand.

Step Definitions: The step definitions link the Gherkin steps to the Java methods that perform the actual actions on the page objects.

Test Execution: The Test Runner is used to run the Cucumber feature files and execute the tests.

Benefits of Using Page Object Model (POM)
Maintainability: Since each page is represented by a separate class, changes to the UI only require updates in the respective page class rather than in multiple test scripts.
Reusability: Common actions for interacting with a page (e.g., clicking buttons, entering text) are written once and can be reused across multiple tests.
Separation of Concerns: The test logic is separate from the UI interaction logic, making the tests easier to read and manage.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to structure automated tests using the Page Object Model (POM) pattern with Cucumber and Selenium. By separating the test logic and UI interaction, the code becomes easier to maintain and scale as the application grows.
